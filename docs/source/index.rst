WNAE: Wasserstein Normalized Autoencoder
========================================

The Wasserstein Normalized Autoencoder (WNAE) is an unsupervised ML algorithm for anomaly detection.
It was developed in the context of a recent search for new physics at CERN by the CMS collaboration.
The WNAE preprint can be found at https://cds.cern.ch/record/2911111.

This work builds on top of Normalized Autoencoders (NAE) developed by Sangwoong Yoon, Yung-Kyun Noh, published in S. Yoon, Y.-K. Noh and F. Park, Autoencoding under normalization constraints, in ICML, pp. 12087-12097, PMLR, 2021, `arXiv:2105.05735 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05735>`__, and available in their github repository https://github.com/swyoon/normalized-autoencoders.
